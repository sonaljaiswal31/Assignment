					BY EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A. Cicero Richard Zare Professor Richard Zrea in his lab. Whether it's the summer grass 
					that tickles your feet on the red Bordeaux smacking on your palate, nearly every part of the world around you
					carries special chemical markers. These markers, called isotopes, can tell scientists where the molecules that
					compose a substance are from, where they traveled and what happened to them along the way. But doing these analyses
					has been complex and costly. Now, Standford chemists have developed a new method to make isotopic analysis easier 
					and less expensive.

					BY CYNTHIA HAVEN L.A. Cicero Lindy Hop instruction Stanford is an epicenter for the vintage dance movement-----but
					life in the Stanford dance world is no all foxtrots and tangos. The June 26-28 Stanford's Dance Weekend in Roble Gym 
					offers something for modern dance enthusisats, too: the hustle, the West Coast swing, 1970s disco hsutle, Bollywood 
					and blues fusion.
